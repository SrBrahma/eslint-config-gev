You can copy & paste the file you want.

If you have a React + TS project, you use `react-ts.eslintrc.js` and remove the `react-ts` from the start of the filename.

If you have a React Native + JS project, you use `react-native-js.eslintrc.js` and remove the `react-native-js` from the start of the filename.
